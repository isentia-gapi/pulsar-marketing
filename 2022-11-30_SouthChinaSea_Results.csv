Why would Thailand want anything to do in the South China Sea? Its a dispute between Vietnam, Phillipines and China. Thailand has no claim in the SCS. And its laughable to suggest any SE Asian country to stand up to China, for obvious reasons. Any sort of posturing have to be done through ASEAN

Japan, Korea and America all had reactionary factions within the country following the end of those conflicts. A perfectly functioning liberal democracy didn't just prop out of thin air. And for a myriad of other reasons, these countries are not born from the same sort of conflict that gave rise to the Soviet Union and Maoist China. There was no massive power vacuum (within both industries and politics) like there was after the Russian and Chinese revolutions like there was in Japan, Korea or America after the war.

Noting that China and Laos enjoy a high degree of political mutual trust, sound mutually beneficial cooperation and friendly people-to-people exchanges, Li said China stands ready to work with Laos to maintain high-level exchanges between the two parties and two countries, further expand and deepen bilateral practical cooperation, and bring more benefits to the two countries and two peoples.

Li said China is willing to strengthen exchanges on governance with Laos to explore the potential of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two parties and two countries.

Noting that China and Laos, both developing countries, have always respected and supported each other, Li said it is hoped that the two sides will do a good job in the operation and maintenance of the China-Laos Railway, improve transport efficiency and facilitation, and better leverage the role of the railway in driving the economic and social development of Laos.

""China is willing to import more marketable quality agricultural products from Laos, and encourages Chinese companies to invest in Laos and expand cooperation on energy, mining, electricity and clean energy,"" said the premier.

Li said China attaches great importance to China-ASEAN relations, and stands ready to work with ASEAN countries to jointly maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.

Thongloun said Laos is willing to strengthen cooperation with China in key areas and promote the driving role of the Laos-China Railway in Laos' economic and social development.

Chinese actions must be judged on their own merits and not on the US's. Does the fact that it is the US deploying forces and accusing China of doing bad things change the merits of said Chinese actions? No. Therefore, we ought to exclude considerations of US choices in the past because they have no bearing on the merit of Chinese actions. I think that the type of argument one is advancing a type of ""Tu Quoque"" logic fallacy. 

Would we consider China putting Uighur minorities into concentration camps ""behaving like any rational actor would [in self-defence]""? Would we consider China meddling in foreign elections ""behaving like any rational actor would [in self-defence]""? Would we consider China arbitrarily arresting two Canadian citizens as a punitive response ""behaving like any rational actor would [in self-defence]""? Would we consider China violating the HongKong handover treaty and repressing HongKongers' civil rights ""behaving like any rational actor would [in self-defence]""? I would say no. In my opinion, none of that is self-defence.  

And in regards to the South China Sea situation, it is not what China has done, but how they did it. They have illegally seized islands, then they claimed not to be building bases, only to later be discovered building bases.

"['sentiment_general', 'topics_general', 'language_general', 'image_analysis', 'emotion_analysis', 'entities']",,,,[],"Liputan6.com, Jakarta - Presiden Joko Widodo atau Jokowi melalui Menteri Sekretaris Negara (Mensesneg) Pratikno telah mengirimkan Surat Presiden (Surpres) tentang Pergantian Panglima TNI kepada Ketua DPR RI Puan Maharani.

Jokowi menunjuk Kepala Staf Angkatan Laut (KSAL) Laksamana Yudo Margono sebagai calon tunggal Panglima TNI menggantikan Jenderal Andika Perkasa yang akan pensiun pada 21 Desember 2022 ini. Nantinya DPR yang akan mengesahkan Yudo sebagai Panglima TNI setelah melalui serangkaian tes dan verifikasi.

Presiden Jokowi mengungkapkan alasannya menunjuk Yudo Margono sebagai calon tunggal Panglima TNI. Kata dia, salah satunya adalah rotasi matra setelah dua periode sebelumnya dipimpin oleh TNI AU dan TNI AD, yakni Marsekal Hadi Tjahjanto dan Jenderal Andika Perkasa.

""Satu, yang kita ajukan satu (calon), KSAL yang sekarang karena memang kita rotasi matra,"" ujar Jokowi saat ditemui di Rumah Adat Radakng, Kota Pontianak, Kalimantan Barat, Selasa (29/11/2022).

Pengamat Politik dari Universitas Al Azhar Indonesia, Ujang Komarudin menilai Jokowi tidak mau berpolemik dalam pergantian Panglima TNI kali ini. Apalagi jika merujuk pada Undang-Undang Nomor 34 Tahun 2004 tentang TNI, seharusnya jabatan Panglima setelah Hadi Tjahjanto pensiun adalah jatah TNI AL.

""Tetapi kan diberikan kepada Andika. Artinya saat ini supaya tidak ada konflik, pertama memang mengajukan satu nama, karena kalau dua nama itu kan menjadi persoalan. Kedua karena ini giliran, ya sudah karena waktunya AL. Jadi secara politik maupun secara aturan dan ketentuan pun Jokowi tidak disalahkan,"" ujarnya saat dihubungi Liputan6.com, Rabu (30/11/2022).

Namun begitu, menurut dia, rotasi matra bukanlah satu-satunya pertimbangan Istana menunjuk Yudo sebagai pucuk pimpinan TNI. Tentu ada juga alasan politis di balik penunjukan jenderal bintang empat TNI AL ini sebagai Panglima. Apalagi saat ini merupakan tahun politik menjelang Pemilihan Umum (Pemilu) 2024.

""Pasti arahannya ke sana juga. Tentu dicari pihak yang tadi bisa mengamankan stabilitas politik. Kedua, juga dicari orang yang lebih dekat di antara ketiga matra itu. Selain dari giliran itu, ya mungkin Jokowi merasa nyaman dan dekat dengan Yudo,"" kata Ujang.

""Jadi saya sih melihat, Panglima itu kan menjaga pertahanan dan keamanan negara, termasuk stabilitas politik. Kalau polisi dan tentara itu harus betul-betul orangnya presiden, karena dia punya senjata, punya kekuatan. Jadi kalau bukan orangnya presiden, bahaya,"" sambungnya.

Yudo Margono sendiri kini telah berusia 57 tahun. Berdasarkan UU TNI, maka Yudo akan pensiun pada 26 November 2023 tepat di usianya yang ke-58. Meski tak genap setahun menjabat sebagai Panglima TNI, Yudo diyakini tetap bisa menjaga stabilitas keamanan jelang Pemilu 2024.

""Saya sih melihat dalam konteks saat ini sampai November 2023 dia dianggap layak dan pantas. Kedua juga memang sudah waktunya (TNI AL). Jadi nanti kalau memang waktunya pensiun ya pensiun, ketentuannya begitu, maka akan dipilih Panglima yang baru. Kecuali kalau sama Jokowi diperpanjang,"" tutur dia.

Ujang berharap, perwira tinggi Angkatan Laut tersebut bisa menjaga netralitas TNI di tahun politik. Ini menjadi tantangan utama Yudo Margono sebagai Panglima TNI, selain juga memastikan stabilitas keamanan nasional jelang Pemilu tetap terjaga.

""Jangan memihak ke sana kemari. Karena TNI itu alat negara yang kepentingannya menjaga keamanan negara, bukan untuk pihak memihak. Jadi ini yang harus dijaga,"" ucap Ujang.

Lebih lanjut, Yudo juga memiliki pekerjaan rumah (PR) yang tak kalah penting, yakni harus bisa mensejahterakan prajurit TNI. 

""Selama ini TNI kan tanda petik masih kalah dengan polisi. Dalam konteks kalau TNI enggak ada mainan, polisi selalu banyak mainan. Ini yang harus dipikirkan bagaimana tentara itu bekerja proporsional, di saat yang sama juga sejahtera,"" katanya menandasi.

Sementara itu, Pengamat militer dari Institute for Security and Strategic Studies (ISESS) Khairul Fahmi menilai bahwa rotasi matra bukanlah satu-satunya alasan Jokowi menunjuk KSAL Laksamana Yudo Margono sebagai calon tunggal Panglima TNI.

""Tentu ada aspek lain baik secara obyektif atau subyektif pengunaan hak prerogatif presiden. Aspek lainnya kelayakan kepatutan terkait dengan kebutuhan presiden. Kalau soal politik, saya kira itu dipertimbangkan sebagai aspek tapi bukan yang utama. Aspek utamanya kelayakan dan kepatutan,"" kata Fahmi saat dihubungi Liputan6.com, Rabu (30/11/2022).

Namun dia tidak sepakat jika tahun politik dikaitkan dengan penunjukan Panglima TNI. Sebab pergantian pucuk pimpinan TNI sama sekali tidak ada kaitannya dengan agenda Pemilu. Fahmi menegaskan, kerawanan atau tidaknya tahapan Pemilihan Umum sepenuhnya bergantung pada integritas penyelenggara maupun peserta Pemilu itu sendiri, bukan Panglima TNI.

""Pengaitan itu justru lebih bertendensi pada upaya menarik-narik TNI untuk cawe-cawe pada agenda politik praktis, bukan politik negara. Saat ini kita berada pada masa reformasi, bukan masa Orde Baru lagi, di mana militer saat itu selain berfungsi sebagai stabilisator dan dinamisator, juga punya peran sangat penting dalam pengamanan dan pemenangan Pemilu,"" tuturnya.

Fahmi mengatakan, memiliki Panglima TNI yang jauh dari sifat politis merupakan gagasan ideal, namun rumit secara faktual. Sebab, bagaimanapun nama Panglima TNI adalah produk politik, berangkat dari usulan yang merupakan hak prerogatif presiden dan melalui proses persetujuan DPR yang merupakan representasi kekuatan politik.

Selain itu, kata dia, militer Indonesia adalah militer yang sejak awal sudah cenderung berpolitik. Militer Indonesia lahir dari kancah revolusi kemerdekaan yang merupakan peristiwa politik. Bagi prajurit TNI, terlibat dalam politik adalah implementasi sifat kepejuangan dalam menyelamatkan dan membela negara.

""Jadi yang paling masuk akal adalah kita memiliki Panglima TNI yang memahami batasan sesuai perundang-undangan, mampu berjarak dengan agenda-agenda politik praktis elektoral dan kekuasaan dan berkomitmen sepenuhnya bahwa politik yang dijalankan dan dikawal oleh TNI adalah politik negara,"" ujar Fahmi.

Calon panglima TNI Laksamana Yudo Margono diketahui akan memasuki pensiun pada 26 November 2023. Masa pensiun Yudo disebut sebagai masa genting sebab terjadi jelang pelaksanaan Pemilu 2024. Wacana perpanjangan masa jabatan Panglima TNI pun kembali bergulir.

Anggota Komisi I Fraksi PAN, Ahmad Rizki Sadig menyebut, segala kemungkinan ada, termasuk memperpanjang masa jabatan Yudo Margono sebagai Panglima TNI hingga Pemilu 2024.

""Ya itu semua dimungkinkan dan menjadi kewenangan prerogatif Presiden,"" kata Rizki saat dikonfirmasi, Rabu (30/11/2022).

Sementara terkait rencana pertanyaan yang akan disampaikan kepada Yudo Margono saat fit and proper test atau uji kelayakan dan kepatutan nanti, Rizki menyebut, salah satu yang akan ditanyakan yakni soal efektifitas masa jabatannya sebagai Panglima TNI yang kurang dari satu tahun.

""Saya sih lebih concern pada masalah masa jabatan yang sama dengan Pak Andika yang cuma satu tahun, sementara tahun 2024 awal kita sudah memasuki Pemilu, sehingga proses konsolidasi jaringan tentara dalam rangka proses pelaksanaan Pemilu yang akan disiapkan selama tahun 2023 saya kira harus menjadi concern-nya,"" kata Rizki.

Kemungkinan kembali munculnya wacana perpanjangan masa jabatan Panglima TNI juga diprediksi Ujang Komarudin. Apalagi waktu pensiun Yudo terjadi hanya beberapa bulan jelang pemungutan suara Pileg dan Pilpres yang berlangsung pada Februari 2024.

""Kalau saya sih menganalisanya mungkin. Sangat mungkin, karena semua sudah diarahkan ke tahun politik di 2024. Jadi kemungkinan diperpanjang, saya menduga ke arah sana,"" kata Ujang.

Berbeda dengan Khairul Fahmi yang menilai sulit wacana perpanjangan masa dinas Panglima TNI dilakukan. Mengacu pada ketentuan Pasal 13 dan Pasal 53 UU Nomor 34 Tahun 2004 tentang TNI, tidak ada aturan yang membuka peluang perpanjangan masa dinas bagi perwira tinggi yang menduduki jabatan tertentu, seperti Panglima TNI.

""Peluang baru terbuka jika dilakukan perubahan pada UU tersebut. Terutama pada kedua pasal di atas, atau Presiden menerbitkan Perppu (Peraturan Pemerintah Pengganti Undang-Undang) sebagai alas hukum perpanjangan. Namun saya memandang tidak ada kegentingan yang dapat menjadi alasan penerbitan Perppu,"" kata Fahmi.

Perpanjangan masa dinas Panglima TNI memang pernah dialami oleh Jenderal Endriartono Soetarto yang menjadi pucuk pimpinan TNI pada 2002-2006. Namun hal itu, menurut Fahmi, tidak tepat untuk dijadikan preseden saat ini. Sebab rezim undang-undangnya berbeda.

""Pak Hendriartono Sutarto itu UU 34 Tahun 2004 belum berlaku. Perpanjangan Pak Hendriartono Sutarto itu terjadi bukan setelah UU 34/2004. Tapi UU 2/88. Jadi setelah UU 34/2004, di dalam UU itu tidak ada klausul yang mengatur soal perpanjangan masa jabatan,"" ucapnya menjelaskan.

Selain itu, Fahmi menegaskan bahwa kemampuan menjaga stabilitas nasional tidak bergantung pada lama tidaknya Panglima TNI menjabat. Sebab, menjaga stabilitas nasional adalah pekerjaan yang berkelanjutan dan berkesinambungan.

""Sehingga kalau dikaitkan dengan waktu yang singkat tentu saja enggak. Karena siapapun yang menjadi Panglima, selama apapun jadi Panglima, dia harus tetap bertanggung jawab menjaga stabilitas keamanan,"" kata peneliti ISESS ini menandaskan.

Pengamat militer dan pertahanan Connie Rahakundini Bakrie menilai penunjukan KSAL Marsekal Yudo Margono sebagai calon tunggal Panglima TNI merupakan langkah tepat. Penunjukan Yudo, menurut Connie, membuktikan bahwa Jokowi ingin menjadikan Indonesia negara maritim yang kuat.

""Presiden memenuhi janjinya, di awal memimpin negeri ini beliau menyatakan bahwa Indonesia harus menjadi negara poros maritim dunia dan harus mewujudkan nawacita, yakni kita harus punya kekuatan pertahanan di dua samudera,"" kata Connie saat dihubungi Liputan6.com, Rabu (30/11/2022).

Menurut Connie, Yudo memiliki pekerjaan rumah (PR) cukup banyak untuk mewujudkan Indonesia sebagai poros maritim dunia. Namun PR itu bisa dirangkum dalam tiga hal, yakni power projection (proyeksi kekuatan), aset, dan kesiapan.

""Power projection yang benar untuk sebuah negara maritim, readiness (kesiapan) yang benar, dan aset yang benar. Itu yang paling penting,"" ujar Connie.

PR kedua, menurutnya bagaimana mempersiapakan segala aset yang dimiliki, termasuk bagaimana menyiapkan aset pertahanan untuk digunakan.

""Kita punya aset, siapkah dia di-deploy? Itu menjadi sangat penting. Dan inilah yang menjadi PR yang menurut saya akan dibawa oleh Pak Yudo,"" ujar Connie.

Selain itu, dia mengingatkan bahwa perang atau ketegangan di negara tetangga juga harus menjadi perhatian Yudo Margono.

""Konstelasi di kawasan juga perlu menjadi perhatian misalnya adanya isu seolah Taiwan, atau Laut China Selatan, atau Indonesia bagian Timur akan menjadi hot spot,"" ungkapnya.

Oleh sebab itu, Connie berharap Yudo mampu membuat road map pertahanan Indonesia yang signifikan di masa kepemimpinannya sebagai Panglima TNI yang cenderung singkat.

""Walaupun ada yang bilang bahwa jangkanya pendek dalam memimpin sebagai panglima baru, tapi jangan lupa beliau mampu akan membuat sebuah roadmap pertahanan yang signifikan, sangat penting, yang mengandung tiga elemen tadi,"" kata Connie memungkasi.

Ketua Komisi I DPR Meutya Hafid menilai, calon tunggal Panglima TNI Laksamana Yudo Margono adalah sosok yang mempunyai rekam jejak mumpuni untuk menggantikan Jenderal Andika Perkasa.

""Beliau ini telah bermitra dengan Komisi I DPR cukup lama dengan posisi beliau sebagai KSAL jadi teman-teman Komisi I sudah cukup mengenal rekam jejak beliau,"" kata Meutya dalam video di akun Instagramnya, dikutip Selasa (29/11/2022).

Secara pribadi, Meutya menilai Yudo sejak menjabat sebagai Panglima Komando Gabungan Wilayah Pertahanan (Pangkogabwilhan) I mampu meredam konflik dan mengamankan wilayah.

""Saya secara pribadi mengenal beliau sejak beliau Pangkogabwilhan ketika waktu itu terjadi insiden dengan Tiongkok di perairan Natuna. Sejak itu kami lihat kinerja beliau cukup baik meredam ketegangan di sana,"" kata dia.

Bahkan, politikus Golkar itu menilai catatan kerja calon Panglima TNI itu cemerlang. Hal itu membuat Komisi I DPR menyambut baik penunjukan Yudo Margono.

""Record-nya selama ini cukup cemerlang. Nanti detailnya, tidak pas kalau disampaikan sebelum fit and proper test sikap dan respons dari kami Komisi I terhadap penunjukan Bapak Yudo Margono. Tapi yang jelas saya cukup memahami dan ikut senang,"" kata Meutya Hafid memungkasi.

Sementara Anggota Komisi I DPR RI Bobby Adityo Rizaldi menilai, penunjukan KSAL Laksamana Yudo Margono sebagai calon tunggal Panglima TNI ini untuk memenuhi prinsip keterwakilan matra secara bergantian.

Penunjukan KSAL sebagai Panglima pengganti Andika Perkasa, menurutnya sangat tepat. Dengan prinsip keterwakilan matra TNI secara bergantian tersebut, maka tidak memunculkan polemik adanya supremasi tertentu.

""Karena kualitas semua kepala staf ini sama, penunjukan Kasal sebagai panglima ini lebih untuk memenuhi prinsip keterwakilan matra secara bergantian menjadi panglima, karena dari periode pertama Jokowi belum ada matra laut jadi panglima,"" kata Bobby.

Terkait fit and proper test Panglima TNI, ia mengungkap yang akan ditanyakan kepada Yudo adalah konsep sinergi peningkatan profesionalitas TNI dengan keterbatasan anggaran dari Kementerian Pertahanan (Kemhan), serta bagaimana tantangan pengembangan postur dan organisasi TNI.

""Karena ini fit and proper test, bukan assesment test, karena kualifikasi Panglima adalah pernah menjadi kepala staf, sehingga memenuhi syarat,"" ujarnya.

Bobby juga berharap institusi TNI di bawah Laksamana Yudo mampu mendukung misi dan visi Presiden Jokowi agar Indonesia bisa menjadi poros maritim dunia dalam waktu yang tidak terlalu lama lagi.

""Dan tetap menjadikan TNI sebagai institusi yang dipercaya dan dicintai masyarakat Indonesia,"" katanya menandaskan.

Kepala Center for Intermestic and Diplomatic Engagement (CIDE) Anton Aliabbas menyebut ada sembilan nama yang berpotensi mengisi jabatan Kepala Staf Angkatan Laut (KSAL) menggantikan Laksamana Yudo Margono. Yudo kini menjadi calon tunggal Panglima TNI yang akan menggantikan Jenderal Andika Perkasa.

""Secara normatif, perwira tinggi berpangkat Laksamana Madya mempunyai peluang untuk dipromosikan menjadi Kasal. Setidaknya ada 9 nama perwira tinggi berpangkat Laksamana Madya,"" ujar Anton kepada Liputan6.com, Rabu (30/11/2022).

Anton menyebut, sembilan perwira TNI AL itu telah memiliki ragam penugasan termasuk memimpin satuan operasi atau tempur. Kesembilan nama tersebut yakni Sekjen Dewan Ketahanan Nasional Laksamana Madya TNI Harjo Susmoro. Harjo lulusan Akademi Angkatan Laut (AAL) 1987 dengan sisa usia pensiun normatif tiga bulan.

Kemudian Kepala Badan Keamanan Laut (Bakamla) Laksamana Madya TNI Aan Kurnia yang merupakan AAL 1987 dengan sisa usia pensiun normatif 8 bulan. Ketiga yakni Inspektur Jenderal (Irjen) TNI Letnan Jenderal TNI (Mar) Bambang Suswantono (AAL 1987) dengan sisa usia pensiun normatif 8 bulan.

Keempat yakni Wakil Kasal Laksamana Madya TNI Ahmadi Heri Purwono (AAL 1988) dengan sisa usia pensiun normatif 11 bulan. Kelima Rektor Universitas Pertahanan (Unhan) Laksamana Madya TNI Amarulla Octavian (AAL 1988) dengan sisa usia pensiun normatif 11 bulan.

Keenam yakni Komandan Pushidrosal Laksamana Madya TNI Nurhidayat (AAL 1988) dengan sisa usia pensiun normatif 13 bulan. Ketujuh Pangkoarmada RI Laksamana Madya TNI Herru Kusmanto (AAL 1988) dengan sisa usia pensiun normatif 16 bulan.

Kedelapan Komandan Kodiklatal Letnan Jenderal TNI (Mar) Suhartono (AAL 1988) dengan sisa usia pensiun normatif 14 bulan. Dan terakhir Pangkogabwilhan I Laksamana Madya TNI Muhammad Ali (AAL 1989) dengan sisa usia pensiun normatif lebih dari 24 bulan.

Anton menyebut, dari sembilan nama tersebut, setidaknya ada lima nama yang pernah bertugas di ring-1 kepresidenan.

""Bambang Suswantono dan Suhartono sama-sama pernah tercatat sebagai Komandan Paspampres di era Presiden Joko Widodo. Lalu Herru Kusumastanto dan Muhammad Ali tercatat pernah bertugas sebagai ajudan Wakil Presiden Boediono. Sedangkan Amarulla Octavian pernah menjabat posisi ajudan Presiden Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono,"" kata Anton.

Menurut Anton, sejak memerintah pada Oktober 2014, setidaknya Presiden Jokowi telah mengangkat tiga nama yang menduduki jabatan KSAL. Menurut Anton, semuanya merupakan lulusan AAL yang lebih muda dari pejabat pendahulu dengan sisa usia pensiun paling sedikit 24 bulan atau lebih.

Sementara, terkait riwayat jabatan sebelum menjabat Kasal, tidak ada pakem tertentu yang dilakukan oleh Jokowi.

""Mengingat penunjukkan Kasal jelas merupakan hak prerogatif Presiden, tentu Jokowi memiliki keleluasaan dalam memilih satu dari sembilan nama yang ada. Apakah akan memilih sosok yang pernah bekerja sama, mengikuti kecenderungan riwayat penugasan atau memilih sosok yang memiliki sisa usia pensiun yang panjang? Atau Jokowi akan memilih sosok yang saat ini sedang bekerja langsung di bawah struktur kendalinya?,"" kata Anton.

Menurut Anton, tak tertutup kemungkinan kandidat calon KSAL bertambah apabila Jokowi mempromosikan perwira tinggi berpangkat Laksamana Muda untuk menduduki jabatan bintang tiga. Apalagi, kecenderungan penunjukan Kasal di era reformasi bukanlah suatu pakem yang mengikat untuk ditaati ataupun diikuti.

""Meski demikian, tentu saja, pemilihan Kasal yang baru kelak hendaknya lebih didasari pada kebutuhan untuk menjaga roda organisasi TNI AL bergerak dinamis dan solid dalam menghadapi ancaman maritim Indonesia,"" kata dia.

Dia menyebut, sejak reformasi bergulir setidaknya ada 13 perwira tinggi yang tercatat pernah atau sedang menjabat posisi KSAL. Dari data tersebut, dapat dilihat beberapa kecenderungan. Terkait riwayat jabatan sebelum menjabat KSAL, mayoritas adalah Wakil Kasal (38,5%), Kasum TNI (15,4%), Irjen Kemhan (15,4%) dan lain-lain (30,7%).

Sementara terkait sosok pejabat pengganti Kasal, mayoritas merupakan lulusan AAL yang lebih muda dari pejabat pendahulu yakni 84,8 persen. Sedangkan pejabat pengganti yang merupakan lulusan AAL lebih senior dari pendahulu mencapai 7,6 persen. Dan pejabat pengganti merupakan teman seangkatan AAL mencapai 7,6 persen.

""Di sisi lain, sosok pengganti Kasal mayoritas memiliki sisa usia pensiun yang relatif panjang yakni lebih dari 24 bulan (77%). Sementara, pejabat yang memiliki sisa usia pensiun 19-24 bulan saat akan menjabat jabatan Kasal (15,4%). Dan sosok yang memiliki sisa usia pensiun 18 bulan saat akan menjabat pos Kasal mencapai 7,6%. Dan dari 13 nama Kasal yang ada, hanya satu orang yakni Laksamana Sumarjono yang pernah bertugas sebagai ajudan Presiden Suharto,"" kata Anton.",ID,,,,,,liputan6.com,,0,,,[],955f57407291afb17cba45bef938af13,"[{'title': '', 'url': 'https://cdn1-production-images-kly.akamaized.net/F1YYNNTly8QaUoVEIteavg6EOZs=/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(75):strip_icc():format(jpeg)/kly-media-production/medias/4242299/original/000430300_1669626429-Kasal_Laksamana_TNI_Yudo_Margono_8.jpg'}]",,10486,,,,"['headline', 'ksal', 'laksamana', 'yudo', 'margono', 'calon', 'tunggal', 'panglima', 'tni', 'dari', 'jokowi', 'alasan', 'pertimbangan']",ms,-0.789275,,[],113.921327,,2022-11-30,0_87317_16_955f57407291afb17cba45bef938af13,0,,,,,,,-0.12048186560471853,,ONLINE_NEWS,,[],"HEADLINE: KSAL Laksamana Yudo Margono Calon Tunggal Panglima TNI dari Jokowi, Alasan dan Pertimbangan?",,2022-12-01,http://ct.moreover.com/?a=49388095912&p=189&v=1&x=FS9_of_rqBLpWvQJ_WHE9g,,,,,,unknown,0,,,,Delvira Hutabarat,Delvira Hutabarat,[],,170.08,from 2022-11-23 to 2022-11-30

Although I believe, they should never have phrased the term ""Belt and Road"" and just kept investing in infrastructure around China to develop the surrounding region, I am not sure exactly why being more assertive is bad. In the South China Sea, Vietnam built military islands and sent warships, which forced China to do the same to tell other countries to do otherwise. In Taiwan, they should have responded aggressively without causing a war, because giving an inch to the U.S. there when it was a clear provocation would have meant that the U.S. would have been tougher on China and maybe would have postured more aggressively by sending more troops to South Korea, which could have escalated a crisis. It's true they should have probably have acted on the sideline to not make Dotard Trump realize just how strong they were, but not sure exactly how not acting assertive against the U.S. would be better.
